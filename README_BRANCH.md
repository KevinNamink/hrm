About the '3.3.0/feature/gc3qm' branch
======================================

This branch contains the merge of the 3.3.0 release into the 'feature/gc3qm'
branch.

Development of the gc3qm branch should be based on top of current 'devel', so
this branch is simply kept for documentation purposes (or rather to compare
stuff).

It can (and should!) be deleted once we have the gc3qm branch working on devel.
